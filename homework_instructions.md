#### Tier 2: Customer Associations (Challenge)

- Add in a Customer association to the project. This will involve creating at least one new Customer model and connecting it with your Burger model.

- What kind of association you would like to use is up to you. Does a Customer have one Burger? Many Burgers?

- For example, you could make a site that logs the name of which Customer ate which Burger, where each Customer only gets one Burger. If you can't think of another type of association, try this one!
